    <h2>I’m currently a 9th-grade student at Chonradsadornumrung School, where I’m deeply focused on my studies, particularly in science and math. My ultimate goal is to become an orthopedic doctor,
a career that aligns with my passion for helping others and my fascination with the human body’s structure, especially bones. The field of orthopedics excites me 
because it combines medicine and hands-on skills to heal injuries and improve the quality of life for patients.</h2>

  <h2>I also love studying languages, as they open doors to understanding different cultures and ways of thinking,
enhancing my communication skills which I know will be useful in the medical profession.</h2>

  <h2>Outside of academics, I enjoy playing sports like football and badminton.
These activities not only keep me physically fit but also teach me important values such as teamwork, discipline, and perseverance—traits that I believe will be essential in both my personal and professional life. Balancing my love for sports with my academic goals keeps me focused,
and I’m driven to achieve my dream of becoming an orthopedic doctor while maintaining a healthy and active lifestyle.</h2>
